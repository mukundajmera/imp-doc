applications :-
Spam Filtering is a popular application of Naïve Bayes algorithm. Spam filter here, is a classifier that assigns a label “Spam” or “Not Spam” to all the emails.

Sentiment Analysis- It is used at Facebook to analyse status updates expressing positive or negative emotions.

Document Categorization- Google uses document classification to index documents and find relevancy scores i.e. the PageRank. 

used for :-  models particularly for disease prediction and document classification. 

used when:- 
1:moderate or large training data set.
2:several attributes
3:classification parameter, attributes which describe the instances should be conditionally independent (independent is most impoartant part).


adv:-
1: works well when input variables are categorical
2: converges faster, requiring relatively little training data (not like  logistic regression)
3: good for multi classes also

used for :- KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. 

Advc :-
1:Ease to interpret output
2:Calculation time
3:Predictive Power


to calculate distance :- Hamming Distance: Calculate the distance between binary vectors 
Manhattan Distance(City Block Distance): Calculate the distance between real vectors using the sum of their absolute difference 
Minkowski Distance: Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distance 
Euclidean distance: distance between 2 point on graph.
